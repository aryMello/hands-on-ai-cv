# Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision Courses and Projects

### Courses:

#### 1. Artificial Intelligence A-Z
- Lunar Lander (DQN):
   - This code implements a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) algorithm to train an agent to solve the LunarLander-v3 environment from the Gymnasium library. The goal of the agent is to learn to control the lander and land it safely on the surface. It uses a neural network to estimate the Q-values for state-action pairs, which are updated using Q-learning, a reinforcement learning technique.

- Pac-Man (DCQN):
  - This code implements a Deep Convolutional Q-Learning (DCQN) agent for the game Ms. Pac-Man, using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. The agent is trained to play the game by interacting with the environment and learning from the outcomes of its actions.

- Kung-Fu (A3C):
  - This code implements a Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) reinforcement learning algorithm to train an agent to play the game Kung Fu Master. A3C is an actor-critic method that uses multiple parallel environments to efficiently train the agent. The code uses Deep Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to process the visual input from the game and learn the optimal policy.
